# Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT (IMDB Dataset)

This repository demonstrates a **Sentiment Analysis** project leveraging the power of **DistilBERT (uncased)**. The model is fine-tuned on the IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify reviews as either positive or negative.

## Features

- **Model**: Fine-tuned DistilBERT (uncased), a lightweight and efficient variant of BERT.
- **Dataset**: IMDB dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews (balanced between positive and negative sentiments).
- **Libraries Used**: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
- **Pipeline**:
  - Tokenization and text preprocessing using Hugging Face Tokenizer.
  - Fine-tuning the DistilBERT model on the IMDB dataset.

## Installation

To set up the environment, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MahnoorMali-k/SentimentAnalysis.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd SentimentAnalysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The IMDB dataset is available through the `datasets` library from Hugging Face. It includes 25,000 labeled training examples and 25,000 labeled testing examples.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The IMDB dataset is loaded using the `datasets` library.
   - Reviews are tokenized using DistilBERT's tokenizer.

2. **Model Fine-tuning**:
   - DistilBERT is fine-tuned on the training set using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Trainer API.
   - Training is optimized using AdamW optimizer and a linear learning rate scheduler.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated on the test set.

## Quick Start

You can open the provided Colab notebook and run all cells to perform training and evaluation on a GPU:
